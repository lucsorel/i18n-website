A sample website and single-page application internationalized with i18n-express.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate the use of [i18n-express](https://github.com/lucsorel/i18n-express) to internationalize the templates:
* of a classic website
* of a single page application
* of the default 404 home page

# Run the demonstration
* install the project dependencies (ExpressJS) with the `npm i` command
* starts the website server with `npm start` (it outputs a few logs while browserifying and uglifying the web application)
* open [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser and there you go!

The `i18n-website/views` folder contains the html templates and their related internationalization JSON resources files (one per locale).
